Objective: For the revascularization in small vessels such as coronary arteries, we present a guide-wired helical microrobot mimicking the corkscrew motion for mechanical atherectomy that enables autonomous therapeutics and minimizing the radiation exposure to clinicians. Methods: The microrobot is fabricated with a spherical joint and a guidewire. A previously developed external electromagnetic manipulation system capable of high power and frequency is incorporated and an autonomous guidance motion control including driving and steering is implemented in the prototype. We tested the validity of our approach in animal experiments under clinical settings. For the in vivo test, artificial thrombus was fabricated and placed in a small vessel and atherectomy procedures were conducted. Results: The devised approach enables us to navigate the helical robot to the target area and successfully unclog the thrombosis in rat models in vivo. Conclusion: This technology overcomes several limitations associated with a small vessel environment and promises to advance medical microrobotics for real clinical applications while achieving intact operation and minimizing radiation exposures to clinicians. Significance: Advanced microrobot based on multi-discipline technology could be validated in vivo for the first time and that may foster the microrobot application at clinical sites.

We described a magnetic chitosan microscaffold tailored for applications requiring high biocompatibility, biodegradability, and monitoring by real-time imaging. Such magnetic microscaffolds exhibit adjustable pores and sizes depending on the target application and provide various functions such as magnetic actuation and enhanced cell adhesion using biomaterial-based magnetic particles. Subsequently, we fabricated the magnetic chitosan microscaffolds with optimized shape and pore properties to specific target diseases. As a versatile tool, the capability of the developed microscaffold was demonstrated through in vitro laboratory tasks and in vivo therapeutic applications for liver cancer therapy and knee cartilage regeneration. We anticipate that the optimal design and fabrication of the presented microscaffold will advance the technology of biopolymer-based microscaffolds and micro/nanorobots.

 The concept of an active drug delivery and controlled drug release using microrobot system has attracted attention over the past decade. However, developing these microrobot system is hindered by the low drug release rate upon external stimuli, such as an alternating magnetic field or light, with a long stimulation period (>40% release upon 10 min stimulation). This study evaluated using self-rolled helical microrobots to provide a controlled drug delivery system that uses magnetic manipulation and provides for highly efficient drug release. The rapid and simple fabrication of helical microrobots that change shape upon exposure to protic/aprotic stimuli was demonstrated using a single-layer self-folding technique. The self-folded helical microrobots navigated in the desired direction using a rotating magnetic field produced by an electromagnetic actuator. After arrival at the target location, non-covalently bonded anti-cancer drugs were released during a short period of ultrasound stimulation. The results demonstrate that, with 1 min of ultrasound stimulation, more than 90% of drug release was achieved. This efficient drug release system could enable the practical application of a microrobot-based drug delivery system.

 This paper proposes a regularization-based independent electromagnetic field control methodology of an external electromagnetic actuator (EMA) for untethered medical microrobot manipulation. The EMA developed in this study consists of six stationary air-filled coils in an orthogonal configuration to generate a 3-dimensional (3-D) gradient magnetic field. Each air-cored coil is considered as a magnetic dipole actuator and independently control it with other coils. However, the independent electromagnetic coil controller derived by a linear combination of magnetic fields often causes an unexpected singularity problem while obtaining input current via inverse electromagnetic field models. This results in a power overshoot and uncontrollable motion of a micro-object along specific orientations in 3-D space. Hence, a novel control approach based on the regularization of singular value decomposition (SVD) is proposed to solve the singularity problem while providing the optimal current input to electromagnets. Initially, electromagnetic field models are derived, simulated, and analyzed for controller design. In the next stage, the regularization-based independent coil controller is obtained numerically and verified experimentally. These methods enable spatial manipulation of a micro-object using six stationary electromagnets in an electromagnetic navigation system (ENS) with enough force and avoids singularity. Simulations and experiments were conducted and could verify the effectiveness of the proposed control method by avoiding singularities in magnetic field control with minimum number of coils.

  Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) provide a promising source for cartilage tissue regeneration strategies. The use of MSCs for such strategies, however, remains challenging due to the low targeting and low chondrogenic differentiation efficiency of these cells to the desired site. In an attempt to overcome such problems, we propose the use of a magnetoresponsive stem cell spheroid (MR-SCS)-based cartilage recovery platform that allows for precise targeting using an electromagnetic actuation (EMA) system to provide magnetic control and low-frequency electromagnetic field (LF-EMF) to allow for biophysical stimulation to promote chondrogenic differentiation. MR-SCSs were fabricated from mouse-derived MSCs that were labeled with magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) using 3D culture methods, and these particles exhibited no cytotoxicity and did not affect chondrogenic differentiation. Locomotion of MR-SCS that was mediated by the EMA system was successfully demonstrated in 3D phantom and ex vivo models. Additionally, LF-EMF stimulation of MR-SCS resulted in increased expression levels of cartilage specific markers, collagen type II, SOX9, and Aggrecan. Finally, histological evaluation revealed an apparent improvement in the regeneration of cartilage tissue in an ex vivo model of the porcine femur in response to LF-EMF stimulation. These results suggest that our experimental platform consisting of MR-SCSs that are subjected to EMA and LF-EMF stimulation may provide a promising therapeutic system for cartilage tissue regeneration.

  This study presents a novel design and a control methodology for an electromagnetic actuation (EMA) system that can generate a high-frequency and high-powered electromagnetic field for enhanced electromagnetic torque and force. The proposed system consists of a two-stage resonance effect control circuit utilizing resonant effects and an automatic capacitance switching method matching the desired frequency. The first resonant effect control stage, which is called the series resonance, is comprised of various capacitors connected with the EMA system, and is designed to compensate for rapid impedance change and phase delay. The second resonant effect control stage, which is called the current-amplified resonant circuit, is integrated to amplify coil currents for high-frequency operation. In addition, the automatically controllable continuous capacitance switching method is proposed to enhance the magnetic field with respect to the desired operating frequency in a wide range. Finally, the resonance control system is applied to the conventional EMA system. In-vitro experiments were conducted on three-dimensional locomotion and a drilling motion control for a helical-shaped microrobot. Both simulation and experimental results showed a significant improvement in the microrobot locomotion ability, speed (235%), and driving force (900%) with respect to the conventional design. The developed EMA control circuit and algorithm can magnify the input current nearly twice the conventional EMA system and extend the operating frequency to a maximum of 370 Hz.

  Targeted cell delivery by a magnetically actuated microrobot with a porous structure is a promising technique to enhance the low targeting efficiency of mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) in tissue regeneration. However, the relevant research performed to date is only in its proof-of-concept stage. To use the microrobot in a clinical stage, biocompatibility and biodegradation materials should be considered in the microrobot, and its efficacy needs to be verified using an in vivo model. In this study, we propose a human adipose–derived MSC–based medical microrobot system for knee cartilage regeneration and present an in vivo trial to verify the efficacy of the microrobot using the cartilage defect model. The microrobot system consists of a microrobot body capable of supporting MSCs, an electromagnetic actuation system for three-dimensional targeting of the microrobot, and a magnet for fixation of the microrobot to the damaged cartilage. Each component was designed and fabricated considering the accessibility of the patient and medical staff, as well as clinical safety. The efficacy of the microrobot system was then assessed in the cartilage defect model of rabbit knee with the aim to obtain clinical trial approval.

  Capsule endoscopes (CEs) have emerged as an advanced diagnostic technology for gastrointestinal diseases in recent decades. However, with regard to robotic motions, they require active movability and multi-functionalities for extensive, untethered, and precise clinical utilization. Herein, we present a novel wireless biopsy CE employing active five degree-of-freedom locomotion and a biopsy needle punching mechanism for the histological analysis of the intestinal tract. A medical biopsy punch is attached to a screw mechanism, which can be magnetically actuated to extrude and retract the biopsy tool, for tissue extraction. The external magnetic field from an electromagnetic actuation (EMA) system is utilized to actuate the screw mechanism and harvest biopsy tissue; therefore, the proposed system consumes no onboard energy of the CE. This design enables observation of the biopsy process through the capsule’s camera. A prototype with a diameter of 12 mm and length of 30 mm was fabricated with a medical biopsy punch having a diameter of 1.5 mm. Its performance was verified through numerical analysis, as well as in-vitro and ex-vivo experiments on porcine intestine. The CE could be moved to target lesions and obtain sufficient tissue samples for histological examination. The proposed biopsy CE mechanism utilizing punch biopsy and its wireless extraction–retraction technique can advance untethered intestinal endoscopic capsule technology at clinical sites.

  This paper presents a robotic capsule endoscope integrated a targeted drug delivery module (DDM) for digestive diseases treatments. The capsule with a big permanent magnet inside is wirelessly controlled and actively moves to target region in gastrointestinal tract by an electromagnetic actuation system (EMA). DDM is a separated body composed of a drug container and a non-power drug-releasing mechanism. The force to expel drug is generated by carbon dioxide gas pressure coming from a chemical reaction inside a propellant reservoir. Where the chemical reaction is activated by a mechanical mechanism that allows dry chemical powders contacting with water at the target point. A small permanent magnet is utilized to separate reagents and wet paper before drug injection. It is designed to be stable during locomotion by virtue of the attractive force of a big permanent magnet. To trigger releasing mechanism, gradient magnetic field from EMA system is created to push small magnet slide down, which allows reagents drop and contact with water in wet paper. The designed DDM has length of 11 mm and diameter of 11 mm. The proposed robotic capsule could show high potentials to be utilized for therapeutic treatment of digestive diseases in practical clinical sites through simulation and ex-vivo experiments.

  Nanorobots are safe and exhibit powerful functionalities, including delivery, therapy, and diagnosis. Therefore, they are in high demand for the development of new cancer therapies. Although many studies have contributed to the progressive development of the nanorobot system for anticancer drug delivery, these systems still face some critical limitations, such as potentially toxic materials in the nanorobots, unreasonable sizes for passive targeting, and the lack of several essential functions of the nanorobot for anticancer drug delivery including sensing, active targeting, controlling drug release, and sufficient drug loading capacity. Here, we developed a multifunctional nanorobot system capable of precise magnetic control, sufficient drug loading for chemotherapy, light-triggered controlled drug release, light absorption for photothermal therapy, enhanced magnetic resonance imaging, and tumor sensing. The developed nanorobot system exhibits an in vitro synergetic antitumor effect of photothermal therapy and chemotherapy and outstanding tumor-targeting efficiency in both in vitro and in vivo environments. The results of this study encourage further explorations of an efficient active drug delivery system for cancer treatment and the development of nanorobot systems for other biomedical applications.

  The fabrication of a medical microrobot with wireless control will allow the device to enhance its accessibility to reach small targets and complex environments in human body. Here, we provide a simple and versatile method to fabricate the helical-shaped microrobot based on self-rolling techniques. We first prepared the UV curable magnetic ink by mixing the photoresist material, E-dent 400 (FDA approved), and permanent magnet, NdFeB nanoparticles, and then patterned the microrobot using an infinity-corrected optical system. The microrobot can be self-rolled to form the helical shape and be steered using electromagnetic actuation (EMA) system. This study demonstrated a simple and efficient strategy to fabricate magnetically driven microrobots with a hollow-helical structure.

  Toward wireless medical microrobot applications driven by an electromagnetic actuation (EMA) system, challenges associated with movability, the electromagnetic force, and the coil system size must be addressed. This paper presents an enhanced EMA system with a higher magnetic field via new coil configurations, an independent magnetic field control method, and application to the multi-degree-of-freedom (DOF) motion of an untethered capsule endoscope. The magnetically actuated capsule endoscope (MACE) system proposed herein consists of an endoscopic capsule with a permanent magnet in the body, eight air-cored stationary electromagnetic coils, and a control system. The coil system is designed to maximize the working space available within a limited equipment space. The MACE is designed to perform full 5-DOF motion, including 3-DOF translation and 2-DOF rotation. The independent magnetic field control method with the new coil configuration enables orientation-independent-driving (OID) control of the capsule endoscope that could not be accomplished by previous EMA systems. The developed system performance was verified by simulations and experiments. The MACE motion in the spatial domain was evaluated with a robotic endoscopic procedure and diagnostic performance by in-vitro and ex-vivo experiments.

  In this paper, we present a novel guide-wired helical microrobot for mechanical thrombectomy in cardiovascular system, especially for calcified thrombus therapeutics. We designed and fabricated a prototype of the helical shape microrobot equipped with a freely rotatable spherical joint connected to a catheter guidewire, that enables drilling capability to remove calcified objects in vascular. The guidewire helps supporting and maneuvering the microrobot against blood flow during thrombus removal procedure. In addition to the microrobot, an enhanced electromagnetic navigation system (ENS) is implemented to utilize high frequency operation based on resonant effect, which enables powerful drilling force of the microrobot. The in-vitro experimental results illustrate that the suggested method could successfully enhance the locomotion and the drilling force of the helical microrobot that would be sufficient for future mechanical thrombectomy application in cardiovascular therapeutics.

  In order to achieve high-current and high-frequency magnetic field in EMAs, the resonance effect is applied in this research. A series capacitors is connected to the EMAs to operate in resonance mode. At desired resonance frequency, the series capacitor’s reactance completely cancel the inductor’s reactance of the EMAs. The only remaining is parasitic resistance of the EMAs, which is relatively small, thus the high-current can be driven through the proposed EMAs at high resonance frequency. Unfortunately, this proposed system can only operate at a very narrow frequency range near resonance and need to change the capacitance with changing frequency. In order to overcome this problem, a variable capacitors are connected to EMAs, and can be switched automatically according to the change of desired operating frequency.

  This paper presents a design and fabrication of millimeter scale walking robot using ionic polymer–metal composite (IPMC) actuator as the robot's leg for walking in terrestrial environment. A small scale of new IPMC actuator based on poly-vinylidene fluoride (PVDF)/polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP)/polystyrene sulfuric acid (PSSA) blend membrane was fabricated and employed in this study to sustain and drive the walking robot with sufficient force and displacement. The PVDF/PVP/PSSA based IPMC actuator with a polymer mixture ratio of 15/30/55 shows improved performances than Nafion based IPMC actuator. To enhance a traction force of the walking robot and to increase the life time of IPMC actuators, the IPMC strips are covered with a thin PDMS (polydimethylsiloxane) layer. A miniaturized terrestrial walking robot (size: 18 × 11 × 12 mm, weight: 1.3 g) with a light weight robot's body which can support 2-, 4-, or 6-IPMC-leg models was designed and implemented the walking motion on the ground at the maximum speed of 0.58 mm/s.

  This paper proposes a terrestrial walking robot using ionic polymer-metal composite (IPMC) actuators based on a poly-vinylidene fluoride (PVDF)/polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP)/polystyrene sulfuric acid (PSSA) blend membrane. The IPMC based on PVDF/PVP/PSSA with a polymer mixture ratio of 30/15/55 shows a higher tip displacement and greater blocking force than Nafion-based IPMC actuators at low dc voltages. An actuation model is developed for the proposed membrane-based IPMC actuators, representing the transfer function between the input applied voltage and the output displacement of the IPMC actuator. For the terrestrial walking robot, we use a two-degrees-of-freedom (2DoF) leg structure because of its superior characteristics in comparison with a 1DoF leg structure. In addition, a kinematic model of the 2DoF leg structure is introduced as a modeling framework based on the actuation model for the analysis of the locomotion using this IPMC leg structure. The simulation results of the actuation model and the kinematic model are compared with the empirical response of 1 and 2DoF legs. A terrestrial walking robot (size: 28 mm × 18 mm × 16.5 mm, weight: 1.2 g) with two 2DoF IPMC legs and two dummy legs has been designed and fabricated. Finally, we demonstrate the walking motion of the terrestrial walking robot.

  Recently, capsule endoscopes have been used for diagnosis in digestive organs. However, because a capsule endoscope does not have a locomotive function, its use has been limited to small tubular digestive organs, such as small intestine and esophagus. To address this problem, researchers have begun studying an active locomotive intestine capsule endoscope as a medical instrument for the whole gastrointestinal tract. We have developed a capsule endoscope with a small permanent magnet that is actuated by an electromagnetic actuation system, allowing active and flexible movement in the patient’s gut environment. In addition, researchers have noted the need for a biopsy function in capsule endoscope for the definitive diagnosis of digestive diseases. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel robotic biopsy device for active locomotive intestine capsule endoscope. The proposed biopsy device has a sharp blade connected with a shape memory alloy actuator. The biopsy device measuring 12mm in diameter and 3mm in length was integrated into our capsule endoscope prototype, where the device’s sharp blade was activated and exposed by the shape memory alloy actuator. Then the electromagnetic actuation system generated a specific motion of the capsule endoscope to extract the tissue sample from the intestines. The final biopsy sample tissue had a volume of about 6mm3, which is a sufficient amount for a histological analysis. Consequently, we proposed the working principle of the biopsy device and conducted an in-vitro biopsy test to verify the feasibility of the biopsy device integrated into the capsule endoscope prototype using the electro-magnetic actuation system.

  This paper presents an approach for controlling wheelchair movement using hand gesture recognition. This method was developed based on the curvature of a hand shapes contour. It is simple and has some features to recognize and offers robustness recognizing gestures of one hand. The curvature based hand gesture recognition algorithms recognizes hand gestures using a combination of hand shape contour geometry and calculating the distance from the center of hand to the convex hull on the fingertips. In this paper, this method is able to recognize 5 different hand gestures in same backgrounds for five status movement of wheelchair like as: forward, reverse, left, right and stop. Experiments are presented to show that the wheelchair is able to move and avoid obstacles autonomously while controlled by its user via the hand gesture.

  This paper is concerned with the development of various ways to control the electrically powered wheelchair. For controlling the wheelchair in the paper, bio-signal recognition is employed, and the system of recognition signals as Electromyogram (EMG), Electrooculogram (EOG) has been developed. The main purpose of designed wheelchair allows persons with severe disabilities to reliably navigate a power wheelchair without using the hands. In the bio-signal recognition using properties of muscle contractions, and eyes movement are computed and identified control commands by comparing the ranges of the parameters to the statistical range information. The user continuously interacts with the wheelchair and controls the speed and the steering using the EOG and EMG. An obstacle avoidance algorithm has also been developed follow the value of the sensor. This wheelchair based on a standard electrical wheelchair includes an onboard computer, sensors and graphical user interface running on a computer.
