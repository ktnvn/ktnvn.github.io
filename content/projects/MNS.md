**Electromagnetic Navigation System** (ENS) is one the most powerful technology to remotely *manipulate* and *navigate* the magnetic objects.
These magnetic objects can be a *hard magnet* (permanent magnet, PM), a *soft magnet* (iron, nickel, etc.), or magnetic materials embedded on a tethered robots (catheters)/untethered robots (micro/nanorobots), which can be magnetically driven by exerting a magnetic torque and force on it. Let’s consider a magnetic object place inside a magnetic field (generated by the ENS), the object is firstly magnetized. Its magnetization depends on its material. In case of PM, it’s a constant in term of amplitude and orientation. On the other hand, the object made of soft-magnet, its magnetization value will vary significantly with field strength and its orientation will be placed along the longest length of robot’s body. The differences between the magnetization and magnetic field will induce the *magnetic torque*. The *magnetic force* is induced by the field gradient and tend to follow the positive pose of gradient field. Depending on the structure of object and the way we exert magnetic force and torque to it, it will result in different locomotion.

**High-frequency and High-powered Electromagnetic Actuation System Utilizing Two-stage Resonant Effects**,

  This study presents a novel design and a control methodology for an electromagnetic actuation (EMA) system that can generate a high-frequency and high-powered electromagnetic field for enhanced electromagnetic torque and force. The proposed system consists of a two-stage resonance effect control circuit utilizing resonant effects and an automatic capacitance switching method matching the desired frequency. The first resonant effect control stage, which is called the series resonance, is comprised of various capacitors connected with the EMA system, and is designed to compensate for rapid impedance change and phase delay. The second resonant effect control stage, which is called the current-amplified resonant circuit, is integrated to amplify coil currents for high-frequency operation. In addition, the automatically controllable continuous capacitance switching method is proposed to enhance the magnetic field with respect to the desired operating frequency in a wide range. Finally, the resonance control system is applied to the conventional EMA system. In-vitro experiments were conducted on three-dimensional locomotion and a drilling motion control for a helical-shaped microrobot. Both simulation and experimental results showed a significant improvement in the microrobot locomotion ability, speed (235%), and driving force (900%) with respect to the conventional design. The developed EMA control circuit and algorithm can magnify the input current nearly twice the conventional EMA system and extend the operating frequency to a maximum of 370 Hz.

  Objective: For the revascularization in small vessels such as coronary arteries, we present a guide-wired helical microrobot mimicking the corkscrew motion for mechanical atherectomy that enables autonomous therapeutics and minimizing the radiation exposure to clinicians. Methods: The microrobot is fabricated with a spherical joint and a guidewire. A previously developed external electromagnetic manipulation system capable of high power and frequency is incorporated and an autonomous guidance motion control including driving and steering is implemented in the prototype. We tested the validity of our approach in animal experiments under clinical settings. For the in vivo test, artificial thrombus was fabricated and placed in a small vessel and atherectomy procedures were conducted. Results: The devised approach enables us to navigate the helical robot to the target area and successfully unclog the thrombosis in rat models in vivo. Conclusion: This technology overcomes several limitations associated with a small vessel environment and promises to advance medical microrobotics for real clinical applications while achieving intact operation and minimizing radiation exposures to clinicians. Significance: Advanced microrobot based on multi-discipline technology could be validated in vivo for the first time and that may foster the microrobot application at clinical sites.

  Nanorobots are safe and exhibit powerful functionalities, including delivery, therapy, and diagnosis. Therefore, they are in high demand for the development of new cancer therapies. Although many studies have contributed to the progressive development of the nanorobot system for anticancer drug delivery, these systems still face some critical limitations, such as potentially toxic materials in the nanorobots, unreasonable sizes for passive targeting, and the lack of several essential functions of the nanorobot for anticancer drug delivery including sensing, active targeting, controlling drug release, and sufficient drug loading capacity. Here, we developed a multifunctional nanorobot system capable of precise magnetic control, sufficient drug loading for chemotherapy, light-triggered controlled drug release, light absorption for photothermal therapy, enhanced magnetic resonance imaging, and tumor sensing. The developed nanorobot system exhibits an in vitro synergetic antitumor effect of photothermal therapy and chemotherapy and outstanding tumor-targeting efficiency in both in vitro and in vivo environments. The results of this study encourage further explorations of an efficient active drug delivery system for cancer treatment and the development of nanorobot systems for other biomedical applications.
